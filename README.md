## Mind Games project

Mind Games is a set of five console games aimed to test and train math skills. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

#### Games include:
* Even - determination of the parity of a number;
* Calc - calculation of the result of a mathematical expression;
* GCD - finding the greatest common divisor;
* Progression - finding the missing number in an arithmetic progression;
* Prime - definition of a prime number.

### Run

```bash
$ make run-dist
```
